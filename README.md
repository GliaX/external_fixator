# NOT FOR CLINICAL USE - Orthopedic external fixator device

**This project is still under heavy development and not for clincal use**

## Introduction
External fixation devices experience a steep surge in need during
mass casualty and increased trauma situations. This project creates
a 3D printable external fixation kit that can be produced with
commodity 3D printers and easily available nuts, bolts, and metal parts.

## Acknowledgments
This project is heavily based on work by the Imperial College London team in producing a 3D-printed external fixator.

## Printing instructions
* PLA should not be used in production. Only PETG or ABS can be used.
